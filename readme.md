# Wordleee

A clone of the popular word guessing game, that runs in the terminal with a fancy ü¶ö (?) UI!

## Features

üîå Based on Node.js (with the amazing [Ink package](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink))!  
üìÖ Follows the same word progression as the original game! (please don't sue me)  
‚ú® Possible to play past (or future) words!  
üòé Playing games in the terminal is really cool?

## How to play

Wordleee is a published npm package.

For today's word, simply run:

```sh
npx wordleee
```

For any other word:

```sh
npx wordleee <number>
```
